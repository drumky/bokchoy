    <h3>Location</h3>
    <p>We lived in eastern part of Singapore and we have no idea where we were born in. Our house is pretty awesome! We have a slide, waterfall, a water pool to swim in on level one and a suspending bridge linking up from mezzanine level to level two which is a desert where we bask and sometimes take naps!</p>
  
    
    <h3>Food</h3>
    <p>Ohhhh...foooodddd! We love food. Well, to be honest.. We eat anything! Pretty much anything. Right now, our masters Axel and Daphne feed us pallets. They are alright but I'm hoping we can have pizza. WE LOVE PIZZA~~~~!! Please please please, can we have pizza every day!?! </p>
    <br>
    Some of our favorite food:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dried_shrimp">Dried Shrimps</a></li>
        <li>Pallets(cos we are health conscious!)</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>Well, Bok is a panic freak! He gets really jumpy when someone enters the room!
    <br>
    Choy is super laid back, always basking, loves to climb stuff! I think he destroyed the cactus that our owners build! He also loves to nap! Nap Nap Nap! There's one time where I caught him sleeping with his face smashed on the wall, his front feet tucked in and back feet sticking out! Kinda cute!
